# Gitflow-Inspired Workflow for Multiple Data Products with Azure DevOps CI/CD

This document outlines a **Gitflow-inspired workflow** for managing a Git repository in **Azure DevOps**, without a `develop` branch, to develop and release **multiple data products** independently. It provides step-by-step instructions for integrating with a **CI/CD pipeline** using `.yaml` files in the `DevOps` folder and **Library variable groups** per **Microsoft Fabric workspace**. The workflow ensures no interdependencies between data products by using isolated branches and artifacts, with rollback capabilities via version tags. It assigns **Data Engineers** responsibility for feature branch management and **Data Product Architects** responsibility for release branch management.

## Overview of the Workflow

This Gitflow-inspired workflow is designed for developing and releasing **multiple data products** (e.g., datasets, pipelines, or analytics models) in a single repository without creating interdependencies. It eliminates the `develop` branch, using `main` as the primary branch for production-ready code and feature integration. Short-lived `feature/*`, `release/*`, `hotfix/*`, and `rollback/*` branches are used for development, release preparation, urgent fixes, and rollbacks, respectively. The workflow is integrated with Azure DevOps and Microsoft Fabric for CI/CD and workspace management, with clear roles for **Data Engineers** and **Data Product Architects**.

### Key Features
- **Independent Data Products**: Each data product is developed and released in isolated branches and artifacts to avoid interdependencies.
- **Simplified Branching**: Uses `main` as the single long-lived branch, with temporary feature, release, hotfix, and rollback branches.
- **Role-Based Responsibilities**:
  - **Data Engineer**: Manages feature branch creation, development, and pull requests (PRs) for merging into release branches or `main`.
  - **Data Product Architect**: Manages release branch creation, feature integration, testing, and deployment preparation, ensuring release readiness.
- **Stable Production Code**: The `main` branch reflects production-ready code for all data products.
- **CI/CD Integration**: Automates testing, building, deployment, and rollback using Azure DevOps Pipelines.
- **Rollback Capability**: Supports reverting to a previous release using version tags.

---

## Branch Types

1. **`main` (or `master`)**
   - Represents the production-ready codebase for all data products.
   - Contains stable, deployed code with version tags (e.g., `v1.0.0-productA`, `v1.0.0-productB`).
   - Serves as the base for feature, release, hotfix, and rollback branches.

2. **Feature Branches**
   - Short-lived branches for new features or changes for a specific data product (e.g., `feature/productA-login-system`, `feature/productB-data-pipeline`).
   - Branched from `main`, managed by **Data Engineers**, and merged into `release/*` branches or directly to `main` via PRs.

3. **Release Branches**
   - Created from `main` by **Data Product Architects** for preparing a production release for a specific data product (e.g., `release/v1.1.0-productA`).
   - Used for integrating features, applying bug fixes, and testing.
   - Merged into `main` after deployment, then deleted.

4. **Hotfix Branches**
   - Created from `main` to fix critical production issues for a specific data product (e.g., `hotfix/v1.1.1-productA`).
   - Typically managed by **Data Engineers** or **Data Product Architects**, depending on urgency and team structure.
   - Merged into `main`, then deleted.

5. **Rollback Branches**
   - Created from a previous version tag by **Data Product Architects** to revert a data product to an earlier release (e.g., `rollback/v1.0.0-productA`).
   - Merged into `main` and deployed, then deleted.

---

## Workflow Description

The workflow supports independent development and release of multiple data products, with clear role assignments:

1. **Feature Development** (Data Engineer):
   - Data Engineers create feature branches from `main` for a specific data product.
   - Merge into a release branch managed by the Data Product Architect or directly to `main` after testing and review.

2. **Release Preparation** (Data Product Architect):
   - Data Product Architects create a release branch from `main` for a specific data product.
   - Integrate features from Data Engineers, apply bug fixes, and coordinate testing.

3. **Production Deployment** (Data Product Architect):
   - Merge the release branch into `main` and tag it with a product-specific version.
   - Deploy the data product to production from `main`.
   - Delete the release branch.

4. **Hotfixes** (Data Engineer or Data Product Architect):
   - Create a hotfix branch from `main` for urgent fixes to a specific data product.
   - Merge back to `main` (with a new tag) and delete.

5. **Rollback** (Data Product Architect):
   - Revert a data product to a previous release by creating a rollback branch from a tagged version and redeploying.

## Managing Multiple Data Products

To ensure **no interdependencies** between data products and manage their development and releases effectively:

- **Isolated Branch Naming**:
  - Use product-specific prefixes in branch names (e.g., `feature/productA-*`, `release/v1.1.0-productB`) to clearly associate branches with specific data products.
  - Example: `feature/productA-data-pipeline`, `hotfix/v1.1.1-productB`.

- **Independent Release Cycles**:
  - Each data product has its own release branches and version tags (e.g., `v1.1.0-productA`, `v1.2.0-productB`), allowing independent release schedules.
  - Releases are merged to `main` without affecting other products.

- **Modular Code Structure**:
  - Organize the repository with separate directories for each data product (e.g., `/productA`, `/productB`) to isolate code, configurations, tests, and artifacts.
  - Example structure:
    ```
    /productA/
      - src/
      - tests/
      - package.json
    /productB/
      - src/
      - tests/
      - package.json
    ```

- **Pipeline Isolation**:
  - Configure the CI/CD pipeline to process only the relevant files for a data product based on changed paths in a commit or PR (using `paths` filters in the YAML).
  - Example: Changes in `productA/*` trigger tests and deployments only for `productA`.

- **Workspace-Specific Variables**:
  - Use Library variable groups per data product and environment (e.g., `fabric-dev-productA`, `fabric-prod-productB`) to manage distinct Fabric workspace configurations.
  - Example variables: `FABRIC_CONNECTION_STRING`, `PRODUCT=productA`.

- **Artifacts Naming Convention**:
  - **Rule 1: Product-Specific Prefix**: Name artifacts with a product-specific prefix to ensure uniqueness and avoid conflicts in the Azure DevOps pipeline.
    - Example: `build-output-productA`, `build-output-productB`.
  - **Rule 2: Version Inclusion**: Include the version number in artifact names for release, hotfix, and rollback builds to track specific builds.
    - Example: `build-output-productA-v1.1.0`, `build-output-productB-v1.2.0`.
  - **Rule 3: Consistent Format**: Use a consistent format: `<type>-<product>-<version>` (e.g., `build-productA-v1.1.0`, `test-productB-v1.2.0`).
  - **Rule 4: Scope to Product Directory**: Ensure artifacts are generated from the product-specific directory (e.g., `/productA/dist`, `/productB/dist`) to maintain isolation.
  - **Rule 5: Avoid Overwrites**: Configure the pipeline to publish artifacts to unique paths in Azure DevOps, preventing overwrites across products.
    - Example: Publish to `$(System.DefaultWorkingDirectory)/$(productName)/dist` as `build-output-$(productName)-$(artifactVersion)`.

- **Role-Based Responsibilities**:
  - **Data Engineer**:
    - Creates and manages feature branches for their assigned data product (e.g., `feature/productA-data-pipeline`).
    - Develops code, writes tests, and submits PRs for review.
    - Ensures feature branches are isolated to the product’s directory and do not affect other products.
  - **Data Product Architect**:
    - Creates and manages release branches (e.g., `release/v1.1.0-productA`).
    - Integrates feature branches from Data Engineers, coordinates testing, and applies release-specific fixes.
    - Manages deployment to production and rollback processes, ensuring version tags and artifacts are product-specific.

## Azure DevOps Setup

Azure DevOps is used for repository management and CI/CD orchestration. Key components include:

- **Repositories**: Host a single Git repository with `main` and product-specific branches.
- **Pipelines**: Defined in `DevOps/azure-pipelines.yml` to automate testing, building, deployment, and rollback for each data product.
- **Library Variable Groups**: Store environment-specific variables per data product and Fabric workspace (e.g., `fabric-dev-productA`, `fabric-prod-productA`).

### Prerequisites
- An Azure DevOps project with a Git repository.
- Microsoft Fabric workspaces for development and production environments per data product.
- Library variable groups set up in Azure DevOps (e.g., `fabric-dev-productA`, `fabric-prod-productA`, `fabric-dev-productB`, `fabric-prod-productB`) with variables like `FABRIC_CONNECTION_STRING` or `DEPLOYMENT_KEY`.

---

## CI/CD Integration with Azure Pipelines

Azure Pipelines automates the workflow using `DevOps/azure-pipelines.yml`. The pipeline:
- **CI**: Runs tests and builds on `feature/*`, `release/*`, `hotfix/*`, and `rollback/*` branches, filtering by data product paths.
- **CD**: Deploys `main` to production for the relevant data product after release or hotfix merges; supports rollback to previous tagged versions.
- **Variable Groups**: Uses product-specific Library variable groups to manage Fabric workspace settings.
- **Artifact Management**: Publishes product-specific artifacts to avoid conflicts.

### Pipeline Goals
- Validate code quality and functionality for each data product independently.
- Automate deployment to Microsoft Fabric workspaces without cross-product interference.
- Enable rollback to a previous release for a specific data product.
- Ensure unique artifact names to prevent conflicts in the pipeline.

---

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### 1. **Set Up the Repository**
   - Initialize a Git repository in Azure DevOps with a modular structure:
     ```bash
     git clone <azure-devops-repo-url>
     cd <repo-name>
     mkdir productA productB  # Create directories for each data product
     git commit -m "Initial commit with product directories"
     git push origin main
     ```
   - Protect the `main` branch in Azure DevOps:
     - Go to **Repos > Branches**, select `main`, and enable **Branch Policies** (e.g., require PRs, minimum reviewers).

### 2. **Configure Library Variable Groups**
   - In Azure DevOps, go to **Pipelines > Library**.
   - Create variable groups for each data product and environment:
     - `fabric-dev-productA`: Variables like `FABRIC_CONNECTION_STRING`, `ENVIRONMENT=dev`, `PRODUCT=productA`.
     - `fabric-prod-productA`: Variables like `FABRIC_CONNECTION_STRING`, `ENVIRONMENT=prod`, `PRODUCT=productA`.
     - Repeat for `productB` (e.g., `fabric-dev-productB`, `fabric-prod-productB`).
   - Link variable groups to pipelines with appropriate permissions.

### 3. **Develop a Feature (Data Engineer)**
   - Create a feature branch for a specific data product from `main`:
     ```bash
     git checkout main
     git branch feature/productA-login-system
     git checkout feature/productA-login-system
     ```
   - Commit changes in the product-specific directory (e.g., `/productA`):
     ```bash
     git add productA/
     git commit -m "Add login system for productA"
     git push origin feature/productA-login-system
     ```
   - Create a pull request in Azure DevOps to merge into a release branch or `main`.
   - Pipeline runs tests (in `DevOps/azure-pipelines.yml`) on files in `/productA`, producing artifact `build-output-productA`.

### 4. **Create a Release Branch (Data Product Architect)**
   - Create a release branch for a specific data product from `main`:
     ```bash
     git checkout main
     git branch release/v1.1.0-productA
     git checkout release/v1.1.0-productA
     git push origin release/v1.1.0-productA
     ```
   - Merge feature branches from Data Engineers or apply fixes:
     ```bash
     git merge --no-ff feature/productA-login-system
     git commit -m "Update version to v1.1.0 for productA"
     git push origin release/v1.1.0-productA
     ```
   - Pipeline tests and builds the release branch, using `fabric-dev-productA` variables, producing artifact `build-output-productA-v1.1.0`.

### 5. **Test and Validate Release (Data Product Architect)**
   - Run tests (e.g., unit, integration) on files in `/productA` via the pipeline.
   - Deploy to a staging Fabric workspace for `productA` (using `fabric-dev-productA` variables).
   - Fix issues in the release branch:
     ```bash
     git commit -m "Fix bug in release/v1.1.0-productA"
     git push origin release/v1.1.0-productA
     ```

### 6. **Deploy to Production (Data Product Architect)**
   - Create a PR to merge `release/v1.1.0-productA` into `main`:
     ```bash
     git checkout main
     git merge --no-ff release/v1.1.0-productA
     git tag v1.1.0-productA
     git push origin main v1.1.0-productA
     ```
   - Pipeline deploys `main` to the production Fabric workspace for `productA` using `fabric-prod-productA` variables, using artifact `build-output-productA-v1.1.0`.
   - Delete the release branch:
     ```bash
     git branch -d release/v1.1.0-productA
     git push origin --delete release/v1.1.0-productA
     ```

### 7. **Handle Hotfixes (Data Engineer or Data Product Architect)**
   - Create a hotfix branch for a specific data product from `main`:
     ```bash
     git checkout main
     git branch hotfix/v1.1.1-productA
     git checkout hotfix/v1.1.1-productA
     git push origin hotfix/v1.1.1-productA
     ```
   - Apply fixes in the product-specific directory:
     ```bash
     git commit -m "Fix critical bug in v1.1.1 for productA"
     git push origin hotfix/v1.1.1-productA
     ```
   - Pipeline tests the hotfix branch using `fabric-dev-productA` variables, producing artifact `build-output-productA-v1.1.1`.
   - Merge into `main` and tag:
     ```bash
     git checkout main
     git merge --no-ff hotfix/v1.1.1-productA
     git tag v1.1.1-productA
     git push origin main v1.1.1-productA
     ```
   - Pipeline deploys `main` to production for `productA` using `fabric-prod-productA` variables.
   - Delete the hotfix branch:
     ```bash
     git branch -d hotfix/v1.1.1-productA
     git push origin --delete hotfix/v1.1.1-productA
     ```

### 8. **Rollback to Previous Release (Data Product Architect)**
   - Identify the previous release tag for the data product (e.g., `v1.0.0-productA`):
     ```bash
     git tag --list | grep productA
     ```
   - Create a rollback branch from the desired tag:
     ```bash
     git checkout v1.0.0-productA
     git branch rollback/v1.0.0-productA
     git checkout rollback/v1.0.0-productA
     git push origin rollback/v1.0.0-productA
     ```
   - Create a PR to merge `rollback/v1.0.0-productA` into `main`:
     ```bash
     git checkout main
     git merge --no-ff rollback/v1.0.0-productA
     git tag v1.0.0-productA-rollback
     git push origin main v1.0.0-productA-rollback
     ```
   - Pipeline deploys `main` to the production Fabric workspace for `productA` using `fabric-prod-productA` variables, using artifact `build-output-productA-v1.0.0`.
   - Delete the rollback branch:
     ```bash
     git branch -d rollback/v1.0.0-productA
     git push origin --delete rollback/v1.0.0-productA
     ```
   - **Note**: Rolling back reverts `main` to the state of the previous tag for the specific data product. Ensure critical fixes from the rolled-back version (e.g., `v1.1.0-productA`) are re-applied in a new feature or hotfix branch if needed.

Best PracticesBranch Naming: Use clear, product-specific prefixes (e.g., feature/productA-*, release/v1.1.0-productB) to avoid confusion.
Role Clarity: Ensure Data Engineers focus on feature development and PRs, while Data Product Architects oversee release coordination and deployment.
Modular Structure: Maintain separate directories for each data product to ensure isolation.
Artifact Naming: Follow the artifact naming convention to prevent conflicts and ensure traceability.
Path-Based Pipelines: Use path filters in the pipeline to process only the relevant product’s files.
Secure Variables: Store sensitive data in product-specific Library variable groups with restricted access.
Automated Testing: Include product-specific unit, integration, and end-to-end tests in the pipeline.
Clean Up Branches: Delete feature/*, release/*, hotfix/*, and rollback/* branches after merging.
Monitor Pipelines: Use Azure DevOps dashboards or notifications (e.g., Teams, email) to track pipeline status.
Version Tagging: Use product-specific tags (e.g., v1.1.0-productA) for traceability and rollback.
Rollback Planning: Test rollback branches in staging before merging to main.

TroubleshootingMerge Conflicts: Resolve in Azure DevOps PRs or locally using git rebase or git merge.
Pipeline Failures: Check pipeline logs for test or deployment errors specific to the data product.
Variable Issues: Ensure product-specific variable groups (e.g., fabric-dev-productA) are correctly linked.
Artifact Conflicts: Verify that artifact names (e.g., build-output-productA-v1.1.0) are unique and correctly scoped.
Fabric Deployment: Verify Fabric workspace configurations and credentials in variable groups.
Interdependencies: Ensure branch names, artifact names, and pipeline paths are correctly scoped to avoid cross-product interference.
Rollback Issues: Confirm the correct product-specific tag (e.g., v1.0.0-productA) and test in staging.
Role Overlaps: Clarify responsibilities between Data Engineers and Data Product Architects to avoid conflicts in branch management.
