ðŸ§  In Fabric OneLake with SQL Endpoint: Are Views Redundant with a Semantic Model?
Not necessarily. Even though Fabric supports rich semantic modeling (especially via Power BI datasets), SQL views can still play a valuable role depending on your architecture and goals.

âœ… Reasons to Use Views in Fabric OneLake (SQL Endpoint)


Data Preparation Before Semantic Modeling

Views can help shape and clean data before it's consumed by Power BI or other semantic layers.
Example: Flattening nested structures, handling nulls, or applying business rules.



Reusable Logic Across Multiple Models

If multiple semantic models or tools (e.g., external reporting systems, notebooks) access the same data, views ensure consistency.



Performance Optimization

Views can pre-filter or pre-aggregate data, reducing load on the semantic model and improving query performance.



Security and Governance

Views can enforce row-level or column-level security at the SQL layer, which complements or precedes semantic layer security.



Simplifying Complex Joins

Star schemas often require joining fact and dimension tables. Views can encapsulate these joins, making it easier for downstream consumers.




ðŸš« When Views Might Be Redundant
If you're:

Using Power BI semantic models that already define relationships, measures, hierarchies, and security,
And your data is clean and well-modeled in the lakehouse tables,

Then adding views just to replicate those joins or logic might be unnecessary and could introduce maintenance overhead.

ðŸ§© Best Practice in Fabric Context


Use SQL views for:

Data shaping
Reusable logic
Security enforcement
Performance tuning



Use semantic models for:

Business logic
Relationships and hierarchies
KPIs and measures
User-friendly metadata
