Here’s a breakdown of the issue and how to resolve it:
Current Behavior:
When using https://graph.microsoft.com/.default (Microsoft Graph API scope), the token’s payload lacks roles, indicating no application permissions are assigned for Microsoft Graph.

When using https://guardinsurancegroup.sharepoint.com/.default (SharePoint API scope), the token includes roles (e.g., Sites.Read.All), indicating the SPN has application permissions for SharePoint APIs.

The 401 Unauthorized error occurs because the Graph API request to retrieve the site ID (/sites/guardinsurancegroup.sharepoint.com:/sites/DnAFluidityPlatform-ReferenceDataProducts) requires Microsoft Graph permissions (Sites.Read.All), which are missing.

Root Cause:
The SPN is configured with application permissions for the SharePoint API (e.g., Sites.Read.All) but lacks equivalent permissions for the Microsoft Graph API.

The https://graph.microsoft.com/.default scope requests all application permissions assigned to the SPN for Microsoft Graph, but since none are configured, the token has no roles, resulting in a 401 error.

Solution:
Update the SPN’s Azure AD configuration to include Microsoft Graph application permissions (Sites.Read.All, Files.Read.All).

Ensure admin consent is granted for these permissions.

Re-run the notebook script to obtain a token with the correct roles and validate the file download.
