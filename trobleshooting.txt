Troubleshooting Steps
Verify Token:
Decode the token at https://jwt.ms to confirm:
The aud (audience) is https://your-tenant.sharepoint.com.

The roles include SharePoint permissions (e.g., AllSites.Read).

Check Azure AD Permissions:
Ensure the Azure AD app has SharePoint application permissions (e.g., AllSites.Read or Sites.FullControl.All) with admin consent granted.

Configure SharePoint App-Only Access:
SharePoint Online requires explicit app-only permission configuration for the app to access the site using app-only tokens.

This involves granting the app access to the specific site collection or tenant via SharePointâ€™s app-only principal.

Test with a Simpler Endpoint:
Try a different SharePoint REST API endpoint (e.g., /_api/web) to confirm whether the issue is specific to GetFileByServerRelativeUrl.

Check SharePoint Tenant Settings:
Ensure the tenant allows app-only access for third-party apps. Some tenants disable this for security reasons.
