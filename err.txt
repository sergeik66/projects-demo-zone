The notebook runs successfully without requiring any parameters.
It reads the Excel DQ Rule Book from the predefined location.
The structure of the Excel file is validated before processing.
Data is transformed and loaded into the dq_rule Delta table without errors.
Logic from den_nbk_pdq_001_dq_template_conversion and den_nbk_pdq_001_write_dq_rules is reused appropriately.
Logs are generated for each major step in the process.
Errors (e.g., missing columns, file not found) are caught and reported clearly.
The notebook can be reused for future Excel DQ Rule Books with the same structure.
