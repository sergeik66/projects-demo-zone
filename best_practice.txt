Compute Cost Management Best Practices
Compute costs in Fabric primarily stem from the use of capacities (F or P SKUs) for workloads like Data Engineering, Data Science, Data Factory, and Real-Time Intelligence. Here’s how to optimize:
	1. Choose the Right Capacity SKU:
		○ Select the appropriate Fabric capacity (e.g., F2, F4, P1) based on workload size and performance needs. Start with a smaller SKU and scale up as needed.
		○ Use F-series for development or small-scale workloads and P-series for production or high-performance scenarios.
		○ Tip: Test workloads in a trial or low-tier capacity to estimate usage before committing to a higher SKU.
	2. Leverage Auto-Scaling and Pause/Resume:
		○ Enable auto-scaling for compute resources (e.g., Spark clusters) to dynamically adjust capacity based on demand, avoiding over-provisioning.
		○ Use pause/resume for Fabric capacities during non-working hours or low-demand periods to minimize costs. Automate this with Azure Logic Apps or schedules in the Fabric admin portal.
		○ Tip: Monitor usage patterns in the Fabric admin monitoring workspace to identify optimal pause schedules.
	3. Optimize Spark Compute:
		○ Right-Size Clusters: Configure Spark clusters with the smallest node size and number of nodes needed for your workload. Use the Starter Pools in Fabric for lightweight jobs.
		○ Enable Dynamic Allocation: Allow Spark to scale executors up or down based on job requirements to avoid idle resources.
		○ Use Delta Lake: Leverage Delta Lake’s optimized storage format to reduce compute overhead for queries and improve performance.
		○ Tip: Profile Spark jobs in the Fabric UI to identify bottlenecks and optimize code (e.g., reduce shuffles, partition data efficiently).
	4. Use Direct Lake Mode for Power BI:
		○ For Power BI reports, use Direct Lake mode to query data directly from OneLake without duplicating data into imported models. This reduces compute costs for data refreshes and transformations.
		○ Tip: Reserve import mode for scenarios requiring complex DAX calculations that Direct Lake can’t handle.
	5. Monitor and Set Budgets:
		○ Use Azure Cost Management + Billing to track Fabric compute costs by workspace, capacity, or workload type.
		○ Set budgets and alerts to notify administrators of spending spikes (e.g., due to unoptimized Spark jobs or runaway queries).
		○ Tip: Integrate cost data with Power BI for custom dashboards to visualize compute usage trends.
		○ Azure Cost Management + Billing: Track and analyze compute and storage costs (https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cost-management/).
		○ Fabric Admin Portal: Monitor capacity and storage usage (https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/admin/).
		○ Microsoft Purview: Catalog and govern data to optimize storage (https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/purview/).
		○ Azure Advisor: Get personalized cost-saving recommendations (https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/advisor/).
		○ Microsoft Learn: Free training on Fabric cost management (https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/paths/get-started-fabric/).
		
	6. Implement Tagging and Cost Allocation:
		○ Apply tags to Fabric capacities and workspaces (e.g., by department, project, or environment) to allocate costs accurately and identify high-spend areas.
		○ Use Azure Resource Manager (ARM) tags for consistent tracking across Azure and Fabric resources.
		○ Tip: Enforce tagging policies via Azure Policy to ensure compliance.

Storage Cost Management Best Practices
Storage costs in Fabric are driven by data stored in OneLake, the unified data lake, and related services like Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 (ADLS Gen2). Here’s how to optimize:
	1. Optimize Data Storage in OneLake:
		○ Use Delta Lake Format: Store data in Delta Lake (Parquet-based) to benefit from compression, partitioning, and Z-order indexing, which reduce storage size and query costs.
		○ Partition Data Strategically: Partition large datasets by frequently queried columns (e.g., date, region) to minimize data scanned during queries.
		○ Enable Compression: Use Snappy or ZSTD compression for Delta tables to reduce storage footprint without sacrificing performance.
		○ Tip: Regularly review table metadata in Fabric’s Data Engineering experience to optimize partitioning and compression.
	2. Implement Data Lifecycle Management:
		○ Archive Cold Data: Move infrequently accessed data to cool or archive tiers in ADLS Gen2, which offer lower storage costs (but higher access costs).
		○ Delete Unused Data: Use Fabric’s Data Factory or scripts to identify and delete obsolete datasets, backups, or temporary tables in OneLake.
		○ Set Retention Policies: Configure retention policies for logs, audit data, or staging tables to automatically expire data after a defined period.
		○ Tip: Use Microsoft Purview to catalog and classify data, making it easier to identify candidates for archiving or deletion.
	3. Minimize Data Redundancy:
		○ Centralize Data in OneLake: Avoid duplicating data across workspaces or external storage accounts. Use OneLake’s unified namespace to share data across domains and workloads.
		○ Use Shortcuts: Create shortcuts in OneLake to reference data in external sources (e.g., S3, ADLS Gen2) instead of copying it, reducing storage costs.
		○ Tip: Audit workspace storage with Fabric’s admin monitoring tools to detect redundant datasets.
	4. Optimize Data Movement:
		○ Reduce Data Egress: Minimize data transfers out of OneLake to external regions or services, as egress incurs additional costs. Keep Fabric workloads in the same Azure region as OneLake.
		○ Use Lakehouse for Staging: Process data within Fabric’s Lakehouse to avoid intermediate storage in external systems.
		○ Tip: Monitor data transfer costs in Azure Cost Management to identify high-egress scenarios.
	5. Monitor Storage Usage:
		○ Use Fabric’s admin portal to track storage consumption by workspace or domain.
		○ Integrate with Azure Monitor to set alerts for unexpected storage growth (e.g., due to unoptimized ETL pipelines).
		○ Tip: Regularly review storage metrics in OneLake to identify large or unused datasets for optimization.

General Best Practices for Cost Management
	1. Conduct Regular Cost Reviews:
		○ Perform monthly or quarterly reviews using Azure Cost Management and Fabric’s monitoring tools to identify waste (e.g., oversized capacities, unused storage).
		○ Involve business stakeholders to align costs with project priorities.
	2. Educate Teams:
		○ Train data engineers and analysts on cost-aware practices, such as writing efficient Spark code or using Direct Lake mode.
		○ Foster a Center of Excellence (CoE) to share best practices and enforce cost policies.
	3. Automate Cost Controls:
		○ Use Azure Policy to enforce cost-saving measures, such as restricting high-cost SKUs or mandating tags.
		○ Automate cleanup scripts (e.g., via Data Factory pipelines) to remove temporary data or pause capacities.
	4. Leverage Free Tools and Trials:
		○ Use Fabric’s free trial (available at https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/) to test workloads without incurring costs.
		○ Explore Azure Advisor recommendations for Fabric-related cost savings, such as resizing capacities or optimizing storage.

Example Cost-Saving Scenario
Scenario: A company runs a daily ETL pipeline in Fabric using a Spark cluster and stores 10 TB of data in OneLake.
Issues: The cluster is over-provisioned (F64 capacity, underutilized), and data is unpartitioned, leading to high storage and query costs.
Optimizations:
	• Downsize to an F16 capacity with auto-scaling enabled, saving ~50% on compute costs.
	• Partition data by date and apply Snappy compression, reducing storage by 20%.
	• Pause the capacity overnight, saving 8 hours of compute daily.
	• Use Direct Lake mode for Power BI reports, eliminating data duplication.
Result: ~40% reduction in monthly costs, with no performance impact.
