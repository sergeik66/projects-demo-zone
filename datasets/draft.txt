Your current $230k base + up to 20% bonus (realized 10% last year) is already strong, especially as a consultant. For an internal move at XXX, they may aim for total comp in the $250k–$350k range for this AVP, factoring in better benefits (e.g., strong 401k match, health plans, stability under Berkshire).Your insider year of work gives huge leverage—they avoid external search costs/risks, and you bring immediate institutional knowledge.Recommended AskAim high in the posted range to anchor negotiations, but stay realistic for their culture. Propose:Base Salary: $275,000–$290,000 (start at $285k or $290k to leave wiggle room; this is ~20–25% above your current base, justified by the leadership scope, permanence, and your proven impact).
Bonus: Target 25–30% (performance-based, aligned with AVP incentives; push for a guaranteed/sign-on element if possible to offset any lower realized bonus history).
Total Target Comp: $350k–$375k+ (base + bonus at target), plus full benefits package.

    
    Subject: Compensation Expectations – AVP of Data Platform Services
      Dear [Recruiter/Hiring Manager's Name],Thank you again for the exciting opportunity to join XXX as AVP of Data Platform Services. 
            After a productive year supporting the team as a consultant, I'm enthusiastic about transitioning internally to help scale the data platform, engineering, and DevOps capabilities in a more integrated way.My current compensation as a consultant is $230,000 base with up to 20% bonus potential (realized at 10% last year). Considering:My direct experience with XXX's systems, stakeholders, and priorities, enabling immediate contributions with minimal ramp-up,
The expanded leadership responsibilities of the AVP role,
Market benchmarks for similar AVP data/tech leadership positions in insurance (including XXX's own posted range for this role of ~$127k–$314k base, plus bonus),
The shift to full-time internal status with enhanced benefits and stability,

My expectations for the role are:
Base Salary: $285,000–$290,000
Annual Incentive/Bonus: Target of 25–30% of base, performance-tied (with clear metrics discussed upfront)
Total Target Compensation: Approximately $360,000–$380,000 (base + bonus at target)

I'm also interested in any additional elements like a sign-on bonus, enhanced equity/RSU (if applicable), relocation support (if needed), or other perks to bridge the transition.I'd love to hear more about the full compensation structure, including bonus criteria, 401k matching, PTO, and other benefits, so we can find the right alignment.I'm very much looking forward to your feedback and continuing the conversation.Best regards,
SergeNegotiation Tips Specific to GUARDIf they counter lower (e.g., base in $240k–$260k): Emphasize your insider value and push for higher bonus target (30%) or a one-time sign-on ($30k–$50k) to make total comp equivalent.
Benefits add real value: GUARD highlights "outstanding benefits" (competitive 401k, health, work-life balance). Ask for details—these could equate to $20k–$40k+ in added worth vs. consulting.
Berkshire influence: They favor conservative, long-term comp over flashy packages—no heavy stock options likely, but strong job security.
Your walk-away: Don't go below $260k base + solid bonus potential to beat your current effective comp ($253k last year).
Next steps: If on a call, ask questions first ("Can you share the budgeted range or typical package for this level?") to gauge before stating yours.
